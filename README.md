# y2logs

This project aims to build a library and a command-line interface to parse and query YaST2 logs. It
is inspired by [Ylogviewer](https://github.com/lslezak/ylogviewer), which allows you to inspect YaST2
logs from the comfort of your web browser.

My main motivation for building this project is learning some more [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) and
playing around with the [nom parsing library](https://github.com/Geal/nom).
